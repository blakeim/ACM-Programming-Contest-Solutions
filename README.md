# ACM-Programming-Contest-Solutions
A series of solutions to ACM programming challenges, each one begins with the number and name of the problem, the general description, and whether or not the solution was successful in solving the problem. 

If youre unfamiliar with ACM competitive programming, essentially teams or individuals are given a problem statement and asked to code a solution. The solution must then, given specific data, produce exactly correct results within an alloted time, usually under three seconds. Generally problems come with sample data, but this data is not the same as the data used in tests. 

These and other problems can be found here
